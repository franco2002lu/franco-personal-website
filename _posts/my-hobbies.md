As a semi-certified adrenaline junkie, I love anything that gets my heart pumping. Snowboarding, mountain biking, along with other high intensity sports are all fair play when it comes to my hobbies. I also love food and traveling since they are the best ways to experience different places and cultures. I also listen to a bunch of music, Spotify Wrapped says that I mainly listen to rap but I disagree. My favorite artists are Daft Punk, Kendrick Lamar, and Kanye, but what I love the most about music is that there is always new genres and songs to explore.

## Sports and Traveling

As I stated above, I love snowboarding. I started snowboarding every winter ever since I moved to California and I have been doing it ever since. I use ski trips as a main way to connect with my friends and my family. Last winter, I went on the longest off piste trail in the world in the French Alps, and it was definitely one of the craziest things I have done. My favorite snowboarder is Travis Rice, his videos snowboarding in Alaska really inspire me. I also love mountain biking, I picked it up during Covid and it was a great way for me to connect with nature during that time. My best friend and I used to go on trails by the beach and watch the sunset after a long day on the mountain.

Traveling is something I hold close to my heart. During my time studying abroad last year, I visited 11 countries in Europe in 4 months. Visiting new places brings me new perspectives and encourages me to grow as a person. My favorite place I have visited is definitely Iceland, the nature there is absolutely out of this world. When I was there, my friend and I rented a camper van road tripped around the southern part of the island. My favorite part of the island was the glacier where Christopher Nolan filmed Interstellar. Since it was one of my favorite movies of all time, visiting the place where it was filmed was absolutely surreal. Other than Europe, I have been to Australia, parts of Africa, and the majority of Asia. The next thing on my bucket list is to visit Patagonia and Bolivia after I graduate.
