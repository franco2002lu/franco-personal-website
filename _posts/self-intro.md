I was originally born in China and I moved to Orange County, California when I was 11 and called it home for the next 7 years. When I was in high school, I was playing badminton competitively. Because of that, I was able to visit a lot of places in the United States while also keeping a balance between badminton and academics. After high school, I decided to go for a change of scenary by moving to Tennessee and I am now a senior at Vanderbilt University, where I found passion in computer science.

## Professional Life

Growing up, I have always had a stem-oriented background while being a free spirit, open to pursuing anything that seemed interesting to me. In high school, I led a research project where my team analyzed 6 months’ worth of tweets to predict price moments of bitcoin using NLP and machine learning. I also shared my passion for STEM with other people through Sci-IY—a school-wide outreach program aimed to help second and third graders develop their interest in STEM. 

Moving on to college, I wanted to leap out of my comfort zone and try out new things. I took advantage of my tech-oriented background during my time at the JLL Technologies apprenticeship, where I got a better understanding of how I can utilize my computer science skills in the real estate industry. I also tried out tech consulting, where I volunteered to be the client manager of my project team and helped our client develop a market entry strategy for the African blockchain market. With all of my efforts to try out new things, I wanted to eventually narrow my focus down to product management and software development. In the past summer, I worked as a full-stack software engineer and digital transformation strategist at Greenbrier Properties while developing cool projects with OpenAI's API. Currently, I am leading a project to develop an AI-powered video-editing tool for content creators.
